## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I think that I did a good work talking about HTML and CSS (more precisely in SASS), but I still have A LOT to learn from both and not to mention acquiring good practices.

Regarding to JavaScript, I am not sure if my code in this project is completely correct, but I have too much to learn of that too, even more than HTML and CSS.
